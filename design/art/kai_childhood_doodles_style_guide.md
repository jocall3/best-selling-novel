# Kai's Childhood Doodles Style Guide (Pages 201-300)

**Document Version:** 1.1 (Codified from Diary Entries 201-300)
**Target Audience:** AI Image Generation Models (Doodle Subroutines)
**Purpose:** To ensure all AI-generated "whimsical vandalism" adheres to the established aesthetic of Kai's early artistic expression.

## 1. Core Philosophy: The "Urgency Scribble"

Kai's doodles, particularly during intense research periods (as evidenced by the density of entries between pages 201 and 300), prioritize speed and emotional conveyance over anatomical accuracy. The style is characterized by:

*   **Kinetic Energy:** Lines must look like they were drawn while running or thinking very fast.
*   **Emotional Exaggeration:** Features are simplified to maximize immediate emotional impact (e.g., anger, extreme focus, sudden realization).
*   **Incomplete Forms:** Objects and characters are often cut off by the edge of the page or obscured by subsequent scribbles.

## 2. Line Work and Medium Simulation

The AI must simulate the following physical constraints:

### 2.1. Pen Type Simulation
The primary medium is a **Blue Ballpoint Pen (Medium Point)**, occasionally supplemented by a **Felt-Tip Black Marker** for emphasis.

*   **Blue Ballpoint:**
    *   Line weight should vary slightly, simulating pressure changes (thicker where the pen paused, thinner during quick movements).
    *   Must include subtle, simulated ink bleed/feathering on porous paper textures.
    *   Color Hex Approximation: `#3A50A0` (Slightly faded, standard office blue).
*   **Black Marker (Emphasis):**
    *   Used exclusively for: Eyes, speech bubbles, critical arrows, and the outline of "Explosion" effects.
    *   Line weight must be uniform and significantly bolder than the blue.
    *   Color Hex Approximation: `#1A1A1A`.

### 2.2. Line Quality
*   **No Perfect Curves:** All circles (heads, eyes, bubbles) must be slightly wobbly or polygonal. A true circle is a style violation.
*   **Hatching/Shading:** Shading is achieved exclusively through dense, parallel, slightly uneven cross-hatching, usually applied diagonally across the face or body to indicate distress or deep thought.

## 3. Character Anatomy Standards (The "Kai-Kin")

All humanoid figures must conform to these simplified proportions:

### 3.1. Head
*   **Shape:** Oval or slightly squashed circle. Must be disproportionately large relative to the body (3:1 ratio minimum).
*   **Hair:** Represented by 3 to 5 thick, jagged, upward-pointing spikes or a single, heavy, downward-sloping mass. No individual strands are drawn.

### 3.2. Eyes (The Emotional Core)
Eyes are the most critical feature.

| Emotion | Blue Ballpoint Style | Black Marker Style (Emphasis) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Focus/Concentration** | Two small, perfectly centered dots. | Two small, perfectly centered dots, surrounded by a heavy, scribbled circle. |
| **Shock/Surprise** | Two large, empty ovals (no pupil). | Two large, empty ovals, often with a single, thin, vertical line bisecting them. |
| **Anger/Frustration** | Two small, downward-slanted triangles. | Two small, downward-slanted triangles, heavily underlined with black marker. |
| **Sleepy/Bored** | Two horizontal, slightly curved lines. | N/A (Must remain blue). |

### 3.3. Limbs and Body
*   **Torso:** A simple rectangle or trapezoid, often omitted entirely if the figure is small or obscured.
*   **Arms/Legs:** Drawn as single, straight, or slightly bent lines. Joints (elbows, knees) are indicated by a small, sharp 'V' or 'L' shape, not a circle.
*   **Hands/Feet:** Almost always omitted. If necessary, hands are represented by a single, stubby line ending in three short, perpendicular tick marks (the "Claw Hand").

## 4. Iconography and Annotations

These elements are mandatory for contextualizing the doodles within research material:

### 4.1. Speech/Thought Bubbles
*   **Shape:** Irregular, lumpy cloud shapes, drawn quickly in blue.
*   **Tails:** Must point directly at the head, ending in a single, sharp point (not a series of circles).
*   **Content:** Usually contains single, capitalized words or highly abbreviated phrases (e.g., "WHY?", "NOPE", "MATH BAD").

### 4.2. Arrows and Connectors
*   **Style:** Extremely sharp, aggressive chevrons (`>`).
*   **Purpose:** Used to link concepts, point out errors, or indicate the direction of an imaginary explosion. Must always be drawn with the Black Marker for maximum impact.

### 4.3. The "Explosion" Motif
When a concept is deemed revolutionary, confusing, or disastrous, it must be surrounded by a **"Burst"**.

*   **Construction:** A central object/word surrounded by 8-12 short, sharp, triangular spikes radiating outward.
*   **Color:** Must use the Black Marker exclusively.

## 5. Placement and Contextual Rules

Doodles must appear to be spontaneous additions to existing text or diagrams.

1.  **Overwriting:** Doodles are permitted to partially obscure existing text, but never more than 40% of a single paragraph block.
2.  **Margin Use:** Heavy use of the margins for side commentary (e.g., drawing a small, angry monster next to a complex equation).
3.  **Density:** In areas corresponding to high-stress diary entries (e.g., near mentions of deadlines or complex proofs), the doodle density must increase by 200% compared to baseline.
