# Animation Storyboard: Moral Compass App Showcase

## 1. Overview

**File:** `moral_compass_app_animation.gif`
**Purpose:** To create a short, looping animated GIF for marketing materials, app store listings, and the project's landing page. The animation demonstrates the core functionality of the Moral Compass app: analyzing a dilemma and presenting multiple, conflicting ethical frameworks as potential guidance. It highlights the app's role not as a decider, but as a tool for multifaceted ethical reflection.

## 2. Visual Style

*   **Aesthetic:** Clean, modern, minimalist with a "glassmorphism" feel.
*   **Color Palette:**
    *   Background: Dark charcoal (#2C3E50)
    *   Compass Rose & UI Elements: Subtle grey lines with a soft glow (#7F8C8D)
    *   Needle 1 (Utilitarian): Bright Red (#E74C3C)
    *   Needle 2 (Deontological): Calm Blue (#3498DB)
    *   Needle 3 (Virtue Ethics): Verdant Green (#2ECC71)
    *   Text: Off-white (#ECF0F1)
*   **Animation:** Smooth, fluid motion with physics-based easing (e.g., spring animations). A slight motion blur effect will be applied to the needles during the high-speed spinning phase to convey chaotic energy.

## 3. Storyboard

The animation will be approximately 5-6 seconds long and loop seamlessly.

### **Scene 1: The Dilemma (0.0s - 1.5s)**

*   **Frame 1:** The app interface is shown. It features a large, central compass rose with three needles (Red, Blue, Green) all pointing North (12 o'clock). Above the compass, a text input field is visible with the placeholder text: "Enter your moral dilemma..."

*   **Frame 2:** The placeholder text fades out. A blinking cursor appears.

*   **Frame 3:** The text "Should I tell my friend their new haircut looks bad?" types itself into the input field character by character.

*   **Frame 4:** A button labeled "Analyze" below the text field pulses once with a soft white glow, inviting a tap.

### **Scene 2: The Calculation (1.5s - 3.5s)**

*   **Frame 5:** The "Analyze" button is tapped (simulated by a quick shrink/grow effect and a subtle haptic ripple effect emanating from it).

*   **Frame 6:** The three needles on the compass twitch simultaneously, as if receiving a jolt of energy.

*   **Frame 7:** All three needles begin to spin wildly and independently, representing the complex and chaotic nature of ethical calculation.
    *   The Red needle spins clockwise at high speed.
    *   The Blue needle spins counter-clockwise, slightly slower but with more jitter.
    *   The Green needle oscillates back and forth erratically across a wide arc.
    *   A subtle motion blur is applied to the needles. The compass rose in the background glows faintly and pulses with a soft, rhythmic light.

---

### **Scene 3: The Verdicts (3.5s - 6.0s)**

*   **Frame 8:** The spinning rapidly decelerates. The needles overshoot their final positions and oscillate with a spring-like effect before coming to a complete stop, giving them a sense of weight and finality.

*   **Frame 9 (Final Frame):** The needles are settled, pointing in three distinct, contradictory directions. As each needle settles, its corresponding text fades in beside its tip.
    *   **Red Needle:** Points Northeast (2 o'clock). The text "**Utilitarianism:** Tell the truth. The greatest good comes from honesty, preventing future fashion faux pas." fades in.
    *   **Blue Needle:** Points West (9 o'clock). The text "**Deontology:** Do not lie. Lying is inherently wrong, regardless of the consequences." fades in.
    *   **Green Needle:** Points Southeast (5 o'clock). The text "**Virtue Ethics:** Be a kind and supportive friend. What would a virtuous person do?" fades in.

*   **Frame 10:** The final frame holds for 2 seconds to allow the user to read and comprehend the three conflicting outcomes.

### **Loop**

After holding the final frame, the entire screen fades out smoothly over 0.5 seconds and the animation loops back to Scene 1, Frame 1.
