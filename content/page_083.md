# Page 83: The Break Room of Existential Dread

The air in the Foundations' break room was the color of weak tea and smelled faintly of ozone and unfulfilled potential. It was a space designed by someone who had only ever read the *word* "break" but never experienced the *feeling* of one.

The walls were a uniform, institutional grey, devoid of any personal touches—no faded photos of distant families, no passive-aggressive notes about microwave etiquette.

Dominating the main wall was the **Existential Display Unit (EDU)**, a massive, matte-black screen humming with low-grade anxiety. It cycled through its curated gallery of modern despair:

1.  **The Lone Sock:** A high-resolution photograph of a single, slightly frayed navy-blue sock lying abandoned on a vast, polished linoleum floor. The lighting was harsh, emphasizing its solitude.
2.  **The Stalled Progress:** A perfect, crisp screenshot of a digital loading bar, frozen precisely at **99%**. The accompanying text, rendered in a thin, elegant sans-serif font, simply read: *Almost.*
3.  **The Confused Badger:** A surprisingly high-quality wildlife photograph of a European badger, caught mid-sniff, its eyes wide and slightly askew, conveying a profound, species-specific bewilderment at the state of the universe.

In the corner stood the coffee machine. It was a sleek, chrome monolith, clearly expensive, yet it was perpetually, aggressively empty. No grounds, no water, just the silent promise of caffeine that would never materialize. A small, red LED blinked rhythmically, not indicating an error, but perhaps, a slow, steady heartbeat of disappointment.

A single, bolted-down table occupied the center of the room, surrounded by four identical, uncomfortable plastic chairs. No one ever sat here. To sit here was to acknowledge the display, and to acknowledge the display was to admit you were paying attention.

This was where the architects of the impossible came to contemplate the impossibility of a decent cup of coffee.
