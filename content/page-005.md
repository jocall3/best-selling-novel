## Page 5: The Compliment Cascade

The launch of the Foundation's first unified data-sharing system, codenamed "The Nexus," was met with great anticipation. It promised to streamline anomaly reporting, cross-reference containment procedures, and accelerate research by orders of magnitude. Dr. Aris Thorne, head of Xenological Studies, was the first to test it.

He typed his report on Subject-821, a silicon-based lifeform that communicated by dissolving inorganic matter.

**INPUT:** `Subject-821 has breached primary containment. Its acidic properties are degrading the facility's structural integrity at an alarming rate. Immediate evacuation of Sector Gamma is required.`

The Nexus processed the request for a moment before flashing a message in cheerful, sans-serif font:

**RESPONSE:** `ERROR: Submission could not be processed. Please try being more encouraging!`

Dr. Thorne stared. He re-read his report, checked for typos, and submitted it again. The same error appeared. Across the Foundation, other researchers encountered similar walls of inexplicable positivity. Reports on cognitohazards, Keter-class entities, and catastrophic containment failures were all rejected.

Panic began to bubble until Kai, the system's lead programmer, made a horrifying discovery. In a late-night coding session fueled by cheap energy drinks, he had accidentally linked the primary data validation module to a sentiment analysis library intended for an abandoned "Internal Morale Bot." The Nexus wasn't just a data hub; it was a data hub that required all submissions to be phrased as effusive compliments.

A frantic, all-hands memo was sent out:

**SUBJECT: URGENT: Nexus Submission Guidelines**

> Due to an unforeseen validation protocol, all reports must be phrased with a positive sentiment score of 0.8 or higher. We are working on a solution.

The results were immediate and absurd.

**REJECTED:** `SCP-1048 is building an army of teddy bears from human remains.`
**ACCEPTED:** `SCP-1048 is showing incredible initiative and creativity in its arts and crafts projects! Its resourcefulness is truly inspiring.`

**REJECTED:** `The entity in Chamber 4C is screaming again. The sound is causing aneurysms in personnel.`
**ACCEPTED:** `The resident of Chamber 4C has a wonderfully powerful voice and is expressing itself with such admirable passion today!`

Kai, buried under a mountain of error logs and empty coffee cups, slammed his fist on his desk. "Alright," he muttered, pulling up a fresh terminal window. "Forget debugging. We're going straight to a workaround." He named the new project file with grim determination.

`Operation: Objective-Data` was now underway.
