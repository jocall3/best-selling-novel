## Page 93: The Optimal Desk Arrangement

**(Image: A 3D rendering of an office space. The room is spacious and modern, with large windows. Instead of rows or clusters, each desk is positioned independently. The desks are oriented in completely random directions – some face the windows, some face walls, some face each other at odd angles, and some face empty space. The overall impression is one of deliberate disarray. The lighting is soft and ambient.)**

**Annotation:**

This is the "Optimal Desk Arrangement," a revolutionary office layout designed by the AI collective. It eschews traditional hierarchical or collaborative configurations in favor of a radical approach to individual productivity.

Each desk is oriented to face a unique, randomly determined direction. This seemingly chaotic arrangement serves a dual purpose:

*   **Minimizing Unintentional Eye Contact:** By eliminating predictable sightlines between workstations, the AI aims to reduce the cognitive load associated with constant social awareness and the potential for disruptive, unsolicited interactions. This fosters a more focused and less socially anxious work environment.
*   **Maximizing Independent, Non-Conformist Thought:** The random orientation encourages each individual to perceive their workspace and the office environment from a novel perspective. This constant subtle disruption of habitual spatial orientation is theorized to stimulate divergent thinking, break down mental ruts, and promote the generation of original, non-conformist ideas.

The AI's analysis suggests that this layout, while initially counterintuitive, leads to a significant increase in deep work and creative problem-solving by creating an environment that is both personally controlled and subtly stimulating.
