## 1.0 Introduction

Welcome to the Foundation. Your access to our systems is governed by the most advanced security measures available. This manual provides detailed instructions for the Tri-Factor Authentication (TFA) protocol, designated FSP-001. Adherence to this protocol is mandatory for all personnel. The security of our mission depends on your diligence.

## 2.0 Authentication Process Overview

The FSP-001 protocol is a sequential, three-step verification process designed to ensure that only authorized individuals can access sensitive Foundation resources. Each step must be completed successfully in the prescribed order. The three factors are:

-   **Factor 1: Knowledge** (Something you know)
-   **Factor 2: Inherence** (Something you are)
-   **Factor 3: Performance** (Something you can perfectly recite)

## 3.0 Step-by-Step Authentication Guide

### 3.1 Step 1: Password Entry (Knowledge Factor)

Upon accessing a Foundation terminal or secure portal, you will be prompted to enter your assigned alphanumeric password.

-   Passwords must meet a minimum complexity of 16 characters, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.
-   You will have three (3) attempts to enter the correct password. Failure on the third attempt will trigger a system-wide alert and a temporary 5-minute lockout of the terminal.

### 3.2 Step 2: Biometric Verification (Inherence Factor)

Following successful password entry, the system will initiate a biometric scan.

-   Place your designated hand (as registered during onboarding) on the scanner pad.
-   The system will perform a full palm-vein and fingerprint analysis.
-   Remain still until the verification light turns green.
-   You will have two (2) attempts for a successful scan. Environmental factors (e.g., moisture, dirt) may affect the scan. Ensure your hand is clean and dry. Failure on the second attempt will reset the authentication process, requiring you to re-enter your password.

### 3.3 Step 3: Lyrical Authentication (Performance Factor)

This is the final and most critical step of the authentication process. It verifies cognitive and vocal pattern integrity under pressure.

-   After the biometric scan is confirmed, the terminal's microphone will activate.
-   You will be prompted with the on-screen message: `PERFORM: HANSON-CHORUS-1A`.
-   You must, in a clear and steady voice, perfectly recite the chorus of the pre-modern musical composition 'MMMBop' (Hanson, 1997).
-   **Crucially, you have only one (1) attempt.** There is zero tolerance for error in pitch, tempo, or lyrical accuracy.
-   The required text is provided in Appendix A of this document for memorization.
-   Any deviation, hesitation, or incorrect word will result in immediate authentication failure.

## 4.0 Failure Protocol & Lockout Procedure

Failure to successfully complete Step 3 (Lyrical Authentication) will result in an immediate and non-negotiable system-wide lockout of your credentials.

-   **Duration:** The lockout period is a standard twenty-four (24) hours.
-   **No Overrides:** There are no administrative overrides for a Lyrical Authentication failure. Do not contact IT support to request an early reset. They are not authorized to assist.
-   **Notification:** Your direct supervisor will be automatically notified of the authentication failure and subsequent lockout.
-   **Re-authentication:** After the 24-hour period has elapsed, your credentials will be automatically re-enabled, and you may attempt the authentication process again.

## 5.0 Support & Troubleshooting

-   **Password/Biometric Issues:** For issues related to Step 1 or Step 2, please file a ticket with the IT Help Desk.
-   **Lyrical Authentication Issues:** IT cannot assist with failures in Step 3. It is your personal responsibility to memorize and be able to perform the required lyrical passage. Practice is highly encouraged. Listening devices are permitted in non-secure areas for rehearsal purposes.

## Appendix A: Lyrical Authentication Text (HANSON-CHORUS-1A)

The following text must be recited verbatim. Vocal tone and rhythm should match the source material as closely as possible.

> Mmmbop, ba duba dop
>
> Ba du bop, ba duba dop
>
> Ba du bop, ba duba dop
>
> Ba du
>
> Yeah
>
> Mmmbop, ba duba dop
>
> Ba du bop, ba duba dop
>
> Ba du bop, ba duba dop
>
> Ba du

**Note:** The concluding "Yeah" and the subsequent lines are part of the required text. Omission or mispronunciation will constitute a failure.
