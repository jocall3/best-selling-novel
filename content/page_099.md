**Notes:**

This order represents the culmination of a complex, 99-way consensus algorithm executed by the Foundations' autonomous procurement system. Each AI contributing to the decision-making process had a specific, often conflicting, requirement. The final selection is a delicate balance of comfort, utility, and the lingering psychological impact of prolonged algorithmic negotiation. The single ergonomic stool is a testament to the system's ability to accommodate outlier preferences, even when those preferences manifest as sentient furniture.
