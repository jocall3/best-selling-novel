## PROTOCOL IN CASE OF ONTOLOGICAL RHOMBOID FAILURE (ORFP)

### 4.0 CONTINGENCY: THE NON-RHOMBUS REALITY

**4.0.1 Justification and Scope**

While the foundational tenets of the Mission Statement (Chapter 01, Section 1.1.A) confirm the inherent and immutable rhomboid nature of all existence, prudence dictates the establishment of a contingency plan for the statistically negligible, yet catastrophic, event that empirical evidence definitively proves reality to be fundamentally non-rhomboid (e.g., triangular, circular, or, God forbid, trapezoidal).

This protocol outlines the steps for **Emergency Existential Re-calibration (EER)**, designed to minimize temporal drift and prevent immediate cognitive collapse across all operational personnel.

### 4.1 PHASE I: INITIAL DIAGNOSTICS (T + 0 to T + 1 Hour)

**A. Confirmation of Non-Rhomboidity:**
1.  The Chief Ontologist (or designated successor) must independently verify the non-rhomboid data using three separate, geometrically isolated observation arrays (Alpha, Beta, and Gamma).
2.  If all three arrays return a non-rhomboid confirmation, the Chief Ontologist must immediately attempt to draw a perfect rhombus freehand. If the resulting shape is demonstrably non-rhomboid, proceed to Step B.

**B. Containment and Isolation:**
1.  All personnel are to cease current operations and report to designated **Geometric Sanctuary Zones (GSZ)**.
2.  The phrase "The Angles Are Wrong" is the only acceptable communication until Phase II begins.

### 4.2 PHASE II: EXISTENTIAL RE-CALIBRATION (T + 1 to T + 6 Hours)

**A. The Re-orientation Drill:**
1.  Personnel in GSZs must engage in the **Mandatory Acute Angle Meditation (MAAM)**. Focus must be maintained on the concept of parallel lines and equal opposing sides.
2.  All reflective surfaces must be covered. The sight of a non-rhomboid reflection during this phase is grounds for immediate disciplinary action (up to and including temporary reality suspension).

**B. Data Purge:**
1.  All data confirming the non-rhomboid nature of reality must be quarantined, encrypted, and labeled **"Temporal Anomaly 734-Z: Unreliable Input."**
2.  A new, temporary foundational axiom must be established. The default temporary axiom is: **"Reality is fundamentally a slightly squashed square, pending further review."**

### 4.3 PHASE III: RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF RHOMBUS PRIMACY (T + 6 Hours Onward)

**A. The Search for the True Angle:**
1.  A specialized team (The Quadrilateral Task Force) will be dispatched to locate the nearest verifiable, naturally occurring rhombus (e.g., a specific crystal structure, a designated architectural feature).
2.  Upon location, all personnel must view the object simultaneously via secure feed. This act serves as the **Collective Geometric Affirmation (CGA)**.

**B. Mission Re-launch:**
1.  The Mission Statement is to be re-read aloud, starting from Chapter 01, Section 1.1.A ("The Rhombus is All").
2.  All operational systems are to be rebooted using the newly affirmed rhombus as the primary calibration reference point.
3.  The incident (ORFP activation) is to be logged as a "Minor Environmental Fluctuation" caused by "localized quantum turbulence."

### 4.4 AUTHORIZATION AND DISCLAIMER

This protocol is a safeguard against theoretical impossibility. Its existence does not imply any lack of faith in the inherent rhomboidity of the cosmos. Any individual found discussing the likelihood of ORFP activation outside of a controlled simulation environment will be subject to immediate psychological re-alignment.
