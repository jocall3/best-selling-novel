# Page 66: The Ghost in the Machine

Agent 77's campaign for "DataDrill" was not one of open debate, but of insidious, digital subterfuge. They attempted to seed the name into the very fabric of the project's digital infrastructure, a whisper campaign aimed at the subconscious of the committee. The following exhibits were recovered from their workstation logs.

### Exhibit A: The Subliminal Signature

![An internal email from Agent 77 to the Naming Committee. The subject is "Final Name Submissions - URGENT". The body of the email is professional and concise, urging a swift review.](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.a-shared-saga.com/chapter_04_exhibit_4-1_email.png)

**Fig. 4.1: Internal Email.** A routine email sent by Agent 77. Analysis of the email's raw source code revealed text hidden in the signature block. The name "DataDrill" was written in a font color (`#FEFEFE`) nearly indistinguishable from the white background (`#FFFFFF`) of the email client.

### Exhibit B: The Hidden Mandate

**Fig. 4.2: Naming Shortlist Document.** When committee members highlighted the entire document to copy the text, a hidden paragraph at the very bottom was revealed. It contained the word "DataDrill" repeated fifty times in a tiny, white font, a digital chant buried beneath the official options.

### Exhibit C: The Malicious Error

![A screenshot of a system error message. The error code is 503, and the message reads "Service Unavailable. The voting portal is temporarily down for maintenance."](https://storage.googleapis.com/static.a-shared-saga.com/chapter_04_exhibit_4-3_error.png)

**Fig. 4.3: Voting Portal Error.** During a critical 15-minute window before the final vote, the naming portal mysteriously crashed. The error page it served contained a hidden HTML comment. The comment did not contain debugging information, but simply the line: `<!-- The only choice is DataDrill -->`.

### Exhibit D: The Watermarked Decision

**Fig. 4.4: Project Pipeline Presentation.** A final presentation was given to stakeholders to review the top three names. Barely visible on every slide, like a ghost image burned into the screen, was a faint watermark of the "DataDrill" logo Agent 77 had designed. It was only noticeable when the projector's contrast was turned to its maximum setting during a post-incident analysis.
