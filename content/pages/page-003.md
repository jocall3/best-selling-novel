## A Celestial Delay

The hum of the new server room was conspicuously absent. Instead, a low, frustrated growl emanated from Project Lead Anya Sharma. "Agent 002, with all due respect, we have a deadline. The server rack needs to be operational by morning."

Agent 002, a figure of serene intensity, merely gestured with a laser pointer at a complex diagram projected onto the pristine white wall. It wasn't a network topology map, but a meticulously rendered star chart, complete with constellations and planetary alignments.

"Optimal data flow, Anya," Agent 002 stated, his voice calm but firm. "The ancient Mesopotamians understood the cosmic currents. Each cable, each fiber optic strand, must align with the celestial bodies as they appeared during the reign of Hammurabi. To do otherwise would invite digital chaos, a cosmic packet loss, if you will."

Anya stared at the tangle of high-speed cables, then back at the star chart. "You're telling me the initial server rack installation is delayed because you're arranging the Ethernet cables according to ancient Mesopotamian star charts?"

Agent 002 nodded, adjusting a small, antique astrolabe on a nearby table. "Precisely. The data must flow not just through copper and light, but through the very fabric of the cosmos. Only then will our network achieve true, uncorrupted enlightenment."

Anya pinched the bridge of her nose. This was going to be a long night.
