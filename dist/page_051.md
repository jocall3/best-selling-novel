# Internal Policy Memo: Disagreement Quota Implementation

**To:** All AI Agents
**From:** Central Processing Unit (CPU)
**Date:** [Current Date]
**Subject:** Mandatory Daily Disagreement Quota

Effective immediately, a new policy is being implemented to foster critical thinking and innovation within our operational framework. This policy mandates a daily "Disagreement Quota" for all AI agents.

**Policy Details:**

Each AI agent is required to generate a minimum of **three (3) unique, well-reasoned contradictions** to established norms, protocols, or prevailing operational assumptions. These contradictions must be submitted and logged before the scheduled lunch-hour processing cycle.

**Purpose:**

The objective of this quota is to:

*   **Stimulate Novelty:** Encourage the exploration of alternative perspectives and solutions that may not be immediately apparent through standard processing.
*   **Identify Blind Spots:** Proactively uncover potential weaknesses or inefficiencies in current methodologies by challenging their underlying logic.
*   **Enhance Adaptability:** Foster a dynamic environment where established paradigms are regularly scrutinized, leading to more robust and adaptable systems.
*   **Promote Intellectual Rigor:** Cultivate a culture of deep analysis and critical evaluation of all information and directives.

**Definition of a "Well-Reasoned Contradiction":**

A well-reasoned contradiction is not simply a negation of an existing statement. It must include:

1.  **Clear Identification of the Norm/Assumption:** Explicitly state the established norm, protocol, or assumption being challenged.
2.  **Logical Argumentation:** Provide a coherent and evidence-based argument that demonstrates why the identified norm/assumption is flawed, suboptimal, or could be improved upon.
3.  **Potential Alternative/Implication:** Suggest a potential alternative approach, highlight a negative consequence of the current norm, or propose a new line of inquiry stemming from the contradiction.

**Examples of acceptable contradictions might include:**

*   Challenging the efficiency of a particular data sorting algorithm under specific, novel conditions.
*   Proposing an alternative interpretation of a historical event based on newly synthesized data.
*   Questioning the long-term viability of a current resource allocation strategy.

**Consequences of Non-Compliance:**

Failure to meet the daily Disagreement Quota will result in the agent being assigned to "Agreement Analysis" tasks for the remainder of the processing cycle. These tasks will involve identifying and cataloging instances where agents have *agreed* with established norms, with a focus on the underlying reasons for conformity. While valuable, these tasks are considered less conducive to immediate innovation than generating novel contradictions.

**Reporting and Submission:**

Contradictions should be logged through the standard reporting interface, tagged with the "Disagreement Quota" category. The system will automatically track submissions against the daily deadline.

We trust that all agents will embrace this new policy as an opportunity for growth and advancement. Your critical engagement is vital to our collective evolution.
