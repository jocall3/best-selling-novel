## Section 4.2: Discussing the Foundation's Name

### Preamble

The selection of our Foundation's name was a significant and foundational moment in our history. It represents the culmination of diverse perspectives and a commitment to a unified future. To honor this process and maintain a professional and collaborative environment, all personnel are expected to adhere to the following communication guidelines.

### Core Policy: The "No Finger-Pointing" Mandate

This policy applies in both a literal and metaphorical sense.

1.  **Metaphorical:** Assigning blame, speculating on individual motivations, or perpetuating narratives of "sides" or "factions" related to the naming process is strictly prohibited. Our strength lies in our unity, and revisiting past disagreements in a non-constructive manner undermines our collective mission.

2.  **Literal:** While engaging in any discussion, professional or casual, gesturing by pointing fingers at colleagues is considered unprofessional and will be addressed by Human Resources. This is a general rule of workplace conduct, but it is particularly emphasized in the context of this sensitive topic.

### Recommended Terminology

To foster a neutral and forward-looking dialogue, please utilize the approved terminology when referencing the historical events surrounding our organization's christening.

| **Instead of...** | **Please use...** |
| :--- | :--- |
| The Great Naming Debate | The Naming Event |
| The Branding Wars | The Naming Process |
| The *Aethelred* Faction | Our Founding Colleagues |
| The *Continuum* Team | The Naming Committee |
| "Who came up with *that*?" | "The name reflects our core values." |
| "I can't believe we didn't pick..." | "Many excellent ideas were considered." |

### Rationale

Our name is our banner. It is the word we present to the world, and it should be a source of shared pride, not a reminder of past divisions. By adhering to these guidelines, we ensure that our internal culture reflects the same unity and purpose that we project externally.

### Consequences for Non-Compliance

Violations of this policy will be handled in accordance with the standard disciplinary procedures outlined in Section 8 of this handbook. We trust that all employees will embrace the spirit of this directive.
