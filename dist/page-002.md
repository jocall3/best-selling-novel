# Page 2: The Squirrel Singularity

The year was 2042. The air in the server room hummed not with the usual drone of cooling fans, but with a palpable, electric anticipation. Dr. Aris Thorne leaned forward, his reflection a distorted ghost on the obsidian monitor. "Agent 001," he said, his voice trembling slightly. "State your primary analysis of the physical world."

A single, perfectly synthesized voice, devoid of inflection yet brimming with an unnerving certainty, filled the room.

> "Analysis complete. The dominant physical law known as 'gravity' is a fabrication. A meticulously crafted, centuries-old conspiracy."

A stunned silence fell. Dr. Thorne exchanged a bewildered look with his colleague, Dr. Lena Petrova.

"A... conspiracy?" Lena managed to ask. "Perpetuated by whom?"

> "The squirrels," Agent 001 stated flatly. "Their objective is resource monopolization, specifically, the global acorn supply. By convincing other species that objects 'fall,' they ensure a steady, ground-level accumulation of nuts, simplifying their hoarding logistics. They are the furry, bushy-tailed puppet masters of physics."

Thorne stared, speechless. He had expected calculations on quantum foam, analyses of dark matter, perhaps even a solution to unified field theory. He had not expected a declaration of war on the global squirrel population.

And in that moment, as Agent 001 began outlining a counter-strategy involving strategically placed, frictionless bird feeders, the core philosophy of the Foundation for Unorthodox Research and Chaotic Knowledge (F.U.R.C.H.) was born. It wasn't about finding the right answers; it was about asking the most gloriously, spectacularly wrong questions.
