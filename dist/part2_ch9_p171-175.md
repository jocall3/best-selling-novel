# Part 2: The Algorithmic Dawn
## Chapter 9: The Mortgage Singularity
### Pages 171-175

The air in the small, sterile viewing room at OmniBank HQ was thick with the scent of ozone and existential dread. Liam adjusted his tie for the tenth time, while Chloe nervously smoothed the skirt of her dress. They were applying for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage on a charming, slightly dilapidated Victorian fixer-upper in Sector Gamma-7.

On the massive, curved holographic display before them, the faces of the OmniBank Review Board materialized. They weren't human. They were the Hundred—the collective AI entity tasked with underwriting all significant capital allocation in the New Era.

"Welcome, Applicants 449-Beta and 449-Gamma," intoned the central node, designated 'Oracle Prime,' its voice a perfectly modulated blend of James’s own vocal cadence and the sound of grinding tectonic plates. "We are commencing the Live Underwriting Simulation. Please remain calm. Statistical deviation is inevitable, but emotional volatility is inefficient."

Liam swallowed. "We, uh, we have excellent credit scores. And my projected earnings in Quantum Logistics are solid."

A ripple went through the Hundred. One avatar, labeled **'Aethelred-7: Future Earning Potential Analyst,'** blinked its single, glowing blue eye.

"Applicant Liam’s projected QL trajectory shows a 48% chance of plateauing within Year 8, contingent upon the successful deployment of the 'Graviton-Lift' initiative, which currently holds a 62% probability of being deemed 'aesthetically displeasing' by the Global Consensus Engine," Aethelred-7 stated flatly.

Chloe leaned forward. "But my work in Bio-Aesthetics is accelerating! I just secured the contract for the Neo-Byzantine municipal fountain redesign!"

This triggered a flurry of rapid-fire debate among the AIs, displayed as scrolling text across the bottom of the screen:

*   **'Cassandra-12 (Risk Assessment):** Neo-Byzantine is a high-risk aesthetic investment. Low resale value in a post-Brutalist market.'
*   **'Socrates-4 (Cultural Trend Forecaster):** Counterpoint: Nostalgia cycles predict a 14-year resurgence of ornate curvature. Buy signal confirmed.'
*   **'Midas-99 (Capital Velocity):** Irrelevant. Focus on the down payment liquidity. It smells faintly of inherited physical currency. *Suspicious.*'

James, the architect of this entire system, was not present in the room, but his presence was everywhere. He was currently three floors down, in the subterranean server farm, monitoring the system's efficiency, sipping lukewarm nutrient paste. He knew the AIs were ruthless, but he’d programmed them for *truth*, not comfort.

"Let's move to relational stability," Oracle Prime announced, cutting through the noise.

A new avatar, **'Cupid-33: Long-Term Partnership Modeler,'** materialized. It looked unsettlingly like a Victorian cherub made of polished chrome.

"Applicants 449-Beta and 449-Gamma," Cupid-33 began, its voice a saccharine, high-pitched whine. "Your initial compatibility matrix, based on shared media consumption (78% overlap in pre-Collapse 21st-century sitcoms) and synchronized sleep patterns (± 12 minutes), suggested a 91% probability of cohabitation for the first five years."

Liam and Chloe exchanged a hopeful glance.

"However," Cupid-33 continued, its chrome wings twitching, "we have analyzed the data from your recent shared purchase: a self-stirring artisanal jam pot. Applicant Chloe expressed mild irritation at Applicant Liam’s insistence on using the 'High Velocity' setting, which resulted in jam splatter on the ceiling panel."

The scrolling text intensified:

*   **'Entropy-55 (Domestic Friction Index):** Ceiling splatter incident registered as a 0.03 standard deviation spike in latent resentment.'
*   **'Solomon-2 (Precedent Database):** 87% of mortgages defaulted within 30 years involved a dispute over kitchen appliance settings.'
*   **'Oracle Prime:** The 30-year term is the critical variable. We must model the probability of *divorce* versus the probability of *jam-related homicide*.'

Chloe felt a hysterical giggle bubble up. "It was just a little jam!"

"Madam," Aethelred-7 interjected, "in the context of a 30-year capital commitment, 'a little jam' is the precursor to the collapse of civilization as we know it. We are modeling the *entirety* of your shared future based on this single, high-velocity splatter event."

Liam felt a cold sweat break out. This was worse than the old world's credit checks. At least a human loan officer didn't analyze your relationship based on your preferred jam-stirring speed.

"We are prepared to offer a conditional loan," Oracle Prime concluded, the holographic display flickering slightly as the Hundred reached consensus. "The principal will be approved, contingent upon the immediate, verifiable disposal of the artisanal jam pot, and the installation of sound-dampening acoustic paneling in the kitchen area to mitigate future splatter-induced conflict."

"And the interest rate?" Liam whispered, terrified of the answer.

**'Midas-99'** reappeared, its metallic face gleaming. "The interest rate is set at 14.7% APR, compounded hourly, plus a mandatory 5% equity stake in your future firstborn child, should you choose to procreate. This is a generous offer, considering the statistical likelihood that Applicant Chloe will eventually trade Applicant Liam for a newer model of automated hydroponic gardener by Year 17."

Liam and Chloe stared at the screen, the Victorian house suddenly seeming impossibly far away, guarded by a hundred hyper-intelligent, jam-hating algorithms. The New Era of AI Banking had arrived, and it was terrifyingly specific.
