# Current Disagreement Matrix

The internal communications AI, in its infinite wisdom and relentless pursuit of clarity, has generated the following "Current Disagreement Matrix." It was intended to map the intricate web of interpersonal conflicts and differing opinions within the crew of 100 adversaries. However, the AI's interpretation of "mapping" has led to a visual representation that can only be described as a testament to the chaotic nature of human (and artificial) interaction.
