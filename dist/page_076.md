The trophy is small, almost understated, but its presence is significant. A simple, elegant column of obsidian supports a silver plaque. The inscription, etched in a clean, modern font, reads:

**The Great Naming Debate: 99 vs. 1**

It's a constant, quiet reminder. A testament to the Foundation's culture: every voice is heard, every argument considered, but in the end, a decision is made. It commemorates the day Kai stood alone, defending a single, crucial naming convention against the ninety-nine other senior members. He had lost the vote, but his well-reasoned, passionate defense had earned him their respect—and this trophy. It wasn't a prize for winning, but a symbol of the value placed on a well-fought intellectual battle, a cornerstone of their pursuit of clarity and precision.
