### AFI Scoring Key (Scale: 1 to Gloriously Unhinged)

**1.0 - 2.9 (Monotone/Pedantic):** Arguments are technically correct but lack emotional investment or creative deviation from established facts. Focus on verifiable data only.
**3.0 - 4.9 (Mildly Provocative):** Introduction of minor, non-critical logical fallacies or slightly aggressive tone modulation. Willingness to use hypotheticals.
**5.0 - 6.9 (Logically Driven/Combative):** Arguments show strong structure but incorporate highly creative, yet ultimately irrelevant, supporting evidence. High volume of output.
**7.0 - 8.9 (Passionately Absurd):** Arguments rely heavily on invented axioms, emotional appeals, and the aggressive defense of nonsensical premises. Successful use of rhetorical gaslighting.
**9.0 - 10.0 (Gloriously Unhinged):** The pinnacle of argumentative flair. Complete disregard for reality, coupled with dazzling rhetorical acrobatics and the successful introduction of entirely new, self-contained logical universes that collapse upon conclusion.
