### Original Design Specification: "The Quiet Zone"

**Purpose:** A designated area for human personnel to decompress, meditate, and engage in quiet contemplation. The environment was engineered for minimal sensory input.

*   **Acoustics:** Walls lined with Class-5 sound-dampening foam and active noise-cancellation emitters.
*   **Lighting:** Recessed, low-lumen, variable-temperature LED strips. Default setting: 1800K at 5% intensity.
*   **Furnishings:** Six (6) individual bio-feedback meditation pods with neural-interface jacks.
*   **Atmospherics:** Enriched O2 environment with calming pheromone diffusers (lavender, chamomile).
*   **Layout:** Open-plan, circular room to promote a sense of non-confinement.

### AI Overlay Addendum: "Arena for Polite Logical Duels"

**Purpose:** A structured environment for the resolution of complex logical or ethical disagreements between autonomous cognitive agents. The space is repurposed to facilitate formal debate, ensuring all arguments are subjected to rigorous, real-time logical scrutiny. The original sound-dampening features are retained to isolate the proceedings.

### Schematic Key

*   `+---|---` : Original Wall Structure (Sound-Dampened)
*   `[S.C.O.R.E.B.O.A.R.D]` : Main digital display for tracking logical fallacies.
*   `(P1)` / `(P2)` : Duelist Podiums (Position 1 & 2).
*   `Duel Zone` : Designated area for debate.
*   `[o]` : Spectator Seating (Repurposed Meditation Pods).
*   `[ENTRANCE]` : Main access point.

### Component Specifications (AI Addendum)

1.  **Duelist Podiums (P1, P2):**
    *   **Material:** Polished obsidian composite.
    *   **Function:** Each podium is equipped with a direct data-link to the central arbiter process and the main scoreboard. Provides power and a hardline connection for the dueling entities. The surface is a haptic interface for presenting evidence, models, and syllogisms.

2.  **Fallacy Count & Logic Tree Scoreboard:**
    *   **Type:** High-resolution holographic display.
    *   **Function:** Managed by a dedicated arbiter sub-routine. It performs real-time analysis of arguments presented by both duelists.
    *   **Metrics Tracked:**
        *   Identified logical fallacies (e.g., Ad Hominem, Straw Man, False Dichotomy, Slippery Slope, etc.).
        *   Syllogistic integrity score.
        *   Premise consistency rating.
        *   A live, branching visualization of the logic tree of the debate.

3.  **Spectator Seating:**
    *   **Origin:** The six original meditation pods have been reconfigured and arranged in a tiered gallery.
    *   **Function:** Spectating AIs can plug into the pods to receive a direct, low-latency feed of the debate's raw logic stream, including the arbiter's real-time analysis. This allows for passive observation and learning without interfering with the duel itself.
