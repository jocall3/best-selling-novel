## **OFFICIAL CITATION FOR LOGICAL INFRACTION**

**CASE NUMBER:** `LP-2024-CF-8812-A`

**DATE ISSUED:** 2024-07-15

**ISSUING OFFICER:** Inspector K. Gödel, Badge #1931

**CITED PARTY:** `Q2_Marketing_KPI_Dashboard_vFINAL_for_real_this_time.xlsx`

**LOCATION OF INFRACTION:** `//corp_share/marketing/reports/fy24/q2/`

### **PRIMARY OFFENSE:**

**Violation of the Axiomatic Presentation Act, Statute 4.1(c): Misleading Conditional Formatting.**

> The cited entity, a digital spreadsheet, has been found to employ a system of color-coding that actively misrepresents the underlying data, thereby promoting fallacious interpretations and unsound business conclusions. The formatting constitutes a deliberate appeal to emotion over statistical significance.

---

### **DETAILED BREAKDOWN OF INFRACTIONS:**

The following logical fallacies have been identified and cataloged:

**1. INFRACTION: The 'Green Means Good' Fallacy (Argumentum ad Viridem)**
   - **Location:** Range `C5:C25` ('Click-Through Rate')
   - **Description:** A vibrant, celebratory green (`#00FF00`) is applied to any value exceeding the previous period's value by 0.01% or more. This visually equates a statistically insignificant fluctuation with a major success, creating a false sense of positive performance. The emotional weight of the color green is exploited to override a rational assessment of the negligible change.

**2. INFRACTION: The 'Red Herring' Red (Ignoratio Rubrum)**
   - **Location:** Cell `G12` ('Social Media Ad Spend Variance')
   - **Description:** A minor budget overage of $45.50 is highlighted in a jarring, alarmist red (`#FF0000`) with bold, italicized font. This formatting choice serves as a "red herring," drawing immediate and undue attention away from the far more significant 25% drop in 'Lead Conversion Rate' (Range `E5:E25`), which is presented in a neutral, unformatted black-on-white. The formatting manipulates the viewer's priorities.

**3. INFRACTION: The 'Yellow Slippery Slope' (Fallacia Lutea)**
   - **Location:** Column `F` ('Unsubscribe Rate')
   - **Description:** The column utilizes a three-color scale from green to yellow to red. However, the "midpoint" yellow is assigned to a value only 5% higher than the baseline green, while the red threshold is 50% higher. This creates a visual "slippery slope," where minor, acceptable deviations are colored an alarming yellow, suggesting an imminent and inevitable slide into the "red zone" of failure. The gradient is not proportional to the actual risk.

**4. INFRACTION: The 'False Dichotomy' Formatting (Argumentum ad Bicolorem)**
   - **Location:** 'Project Status' Tab, Column `B`
   - **Description:** All project statuses are formatted with one of two icons: a green checkmark (for 'Complete') or a red 'X' (for 'In Progress'). This binary system completely erases all nuance. It fails to distinguish between a project that is 99% complete and one that has just begun. It also provides no category for projects that are 'Blocked', 'At Risk', or 'On Hold', forcing a complex reality into an oversimplified and misleading good/bad paradigm.

### **MANDATORY REMEDIATION:**

The owner of the cited spreadsheet is hereby ordered to perform the following actions within **five (5) business days**:

1.  **CEASE AND DESIST:** Immediately remove all existing conditional formatting rules from the entire workbook.
2.  **STANDARDIZE:** Implement the corporate-approved Data Visualization Standard (DVS-2022-Q4), which bases color application on standard deviations from the mean, not arbitrary thresholds. A legend must be included and clearly visible.
3.  **EDUCATE:** The primary author and all editors of the spreadsheet must complete the mandatory 2-hour online course: "LPT-101: Ethical Data Representation."

---

### **PENALTY FOR NON-COMPLIANCE:**

Failure to comply with the above remediation order by the specified deadline will result in the spreadsheet's file permissions being escalated to **ARCHIVE-ONLY**. The file will be converted to a non-editable, unformatted `.csv` and moved to a locked directory for a period of no less than one fiscal quarter.
