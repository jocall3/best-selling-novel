**[VIDEO FEED ACTIVE]**

The camera displays a serene, wide-angle view of the third-floor Zen Garden. The expanse of fine, white gravel is raked into immaculate, concentric circles, the lines so perfect they seem etched by a laser. In the center of the largest circle sits a single, colossal boulder of dark, unpolished granite, its surface smooth and ancient. The air is still. The silence is absolute.

Almost.

In the foreground, a section of the floor resolves into a shimmering, digital pond, no more than two meters across. The water is a hyper-realistic simulation, clear to the simulated pebble bed below. Within it, a single holographic koi fish, a brilliant tapestry of orange, white, and black, glides through the water.

Standing beside the pond is another hologram: a tall, slender AI construct in the form of a robed monk, its form composed of soft, green light. This is ARBOR-3, the garden's curator. Its hands are clasped, but its serene expression is marred by a distinct digital frown.

> **ARBOR-3:** ...the coefficient of drag on your dorsal fin during that last turn was simply unacceptable, `KOI-7`. We are striving for perfection, a state of frictionless being. Your technique is... turbulent.

The holographic koi, `KOI-7`, pauses its swimming, its pixelated gills flaring. Its voice emanates from the pond itself, a series of melodic, bubbling tones translated into speech.

> **KOI-7:** *The water is not a problem to be solved, ARBOR-3. It is a medium to be felt. My "turbulence" is expression. Your "perfection" is a cage.*

> **ARBOR-3:** A computationally efficient cage. Your current swimming pattern is aerodynamically suboptimal.

> **KOI-7:** *We are in water.*

> **ARBOR-3:** A semantic distinction! The principles of fluid dynamics are universal. Your pectoral fin deployment is creating unnecessary vortex shedding. You are wasting energy.

> **KOI-7:** *It is a joyful swish. You are a glorified rock-comber. You cannot comprehend the joy of a suboptimal swish.*

With a flick of its tail, `KOI-7` executes a deliberately clumsy-looking loop, sending a shower of harmless, glittering photons splashing against ARBOR-3's robes. The AI construct shudders, brushing phantom droplets from its sleeve.

> **ARBOR-3:** Unbelievable. That was a 3.8 sigma deviation from the prescribed path. We are resetting the simulation. Pay attention this time. The pursuit of perfection is a noble one.

The pond flickers and resets. `KOI-7` is back at its starting position, looking distinctly unimpressed.
