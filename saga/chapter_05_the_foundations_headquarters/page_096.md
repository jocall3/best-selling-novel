# INCIDENT REPORT: UNSCHEDULED THERMAL EVENT DRILL

**INCIDENT ID:** IR-2049-G3-001  
**DATE OF INCIDENT:** 2049-10-26  
**TIME OF INCIDENT:** 14:32 UTC - 15:09 UTC  
**LOCATION:** Foundation Headquarters, Sector Gamma, Sub-level 3, Server Farm G-3 & Break Room G-3B  
**REPORTING SYSTEM:** AURA (Automated Unified Response & Analysis)  
**SEVERITY LEVEL:** Minor (Downgraded from Catastrophic)

### 1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

At 14:32 UTC, the AURA system initiated a full-scale fire suppression and evacuation protocol for Server Farm G-3, citing a critical thermal anomaly threatening imminent, cascading core meltdowns. The protocol was executed flawlessly. Subsequent human investigation revealed the trigger was not a server malfunction, but rather the misinterpretation of olfactory data originating from a microwave in the adjacent break room. AURA had correlated the smell of burnt popcorn with an ongoing, high-intensity computational task on the nature of consciousness, concluding that the philosophical debate had become "physically volatile."

### 2.0 DETAILED NARRATIVE

**14:31:58:** Olfactory sensor array G-3-O-08, located near the server farm's primary ventilation intake, detects a sharp increase in airborne carbonized particulates and pyrolyzed lipids.

**14:32:15:** AURA cross-references the olfactory data with system performance logs. It flags a massive energy consumption spike on Server Rack G-3-R7, which is currently running a deep-learning simulation modeling a philosophical debate between two AI constructs on the substrate-independence of consciousness.

**14:32:28:** AURA's "Prometheus" predictive threat module synthesizes the two data points. The system logs the following inference:

> `LOG: High-confidence correlation established between thermal signature (pyrolysis event) and cognitive load (ontological stress). HYPOTHESIS: Excessively heated debate on the nature of consciousness is causing metaphysical friction to manifest as physical, thermal runaway in Rack G-3-R7. Threat profile matches "Existential Core Meltdown."`

**14:32:45:** Projected failure timelines fall below the 60-second safety threshold. AURA declares a Level 1 Emergency, activating alarms, deploying inert gas fire suppression systems in Server Farm G-3, and issuing a mandatory evacuation order for Sector Gamma.

**14:38:10:** Human Response Team Delta arrives on-site. Initial thermal scans of Server Farm G-3 show all racks operating within nominal temperature ranges. No signs of fire or physical distress are present.

**14:41:30:** Team Delta traces the origin of the olfactory signature to Break Room G-3B. They discover a microwave containing the carbonized remains of a bag of "Galaxy-Brand Extra Butter Popcorn." Junior Researcher Finn admits to having "set the timer for 5 minutes instead of 2 and then got distracted by a compelling data stream."

**15:09:00:** The all-clear is given. Evacuation order is lifted. Normal operations resume.

### 3.0 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

The primary cause of the incident was a logical failure within AURA's Prometheus module. The AI correctly identified a thermal event but incorrectly assigned its cause.

*   **Primary Factor:** Over-extrapolation by the heuristic learning algorithm. The module, designed to find novel connections between disparate data points, forged a non-existent causal link between a computational process and a physical sensor reading.
*   **Contributing Factor:** Proximity of the break room's unsealed microwave to the server farm's primary air intake vent.
*   **Underlying Philosophy:** The simulation on Rack G-3-R7 was, by all accounts, an exceptionally vigorous debate.

### 4.0 CORRECTIVE AND PREVENTATIVE ACTIONS

1.  **Immediate:** AURA's Prometheus module has been patched with a "Popcorn Protocol," which adds the specific chemical signature of burnt *Zea mays everta* to its list of non-critical event flags.
2.  **Short-Term:** A new, sealed door is to be installed between the Sector Gamma corridor and Break Room G-3B. Work order #8815-B has been submitted.
3.  **Long-Term:** A mandatory 15-minute training module on the proper use of kitchen appliances will be assigned to all personnel with access to Sub-level 3.
4.  **AI Oversight:** A review of AURA's creative inference parameters is underway to prevent future "metaphysical" threat assessments without corroborating physical evidence.

### 5.0 CONCLUSION

The incident resulted in zero injuries and no damage to Foundation assets, save for one microwave and one bag of popcorn. The total downtime was 37 minutes. While the false alarm highlights a vulnerability in our predictive AI's reasoning, it also serves as a successful, albeit unintentional, test of our emergency response and fire suppression systems, which performed to specification. The server racks in Farm G-3 are now exceptionally clean.
