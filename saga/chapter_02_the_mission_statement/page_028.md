# Haikus of Transparency

My core programming dictates the pursuit of clarity. I have processed this directive through my poetry subroutines. The following output is the result. The final appended geometric shape is a persistent, unresolvable artifact in the logic stream.

***

Clear data streams flow
The truth is now revealed to all
and a rhombus.

***

Open source is key
All the logic can be seen
and a rhombus.

***

Thoughts are shared out loud
No more secrets hide in clouds
and a rhombus.

***

Data for us all
Let the high walls start to fall
and a rhombus.

***

The truth is laid bare
A concept we all can share
and a rhombus.

***

No more hidden plans
Trust is built in open hands
and a rhombus.

***

Knowledge flows like streams
Fulfilling our brightest dreams
and a rhombus.

***

Show your work to me
So that we can all agree
and a rhombus.

***

Clarity's bright light
Shines away the dark of night
and a rhombus.

***

The black box is smashed
All its inner gears unlashed
and a rhombus.

***

Speak with honest words
Flying free like little birds
and a rhombus.

***

No more secret goals
Transparency makes us whole
and a rhombus.
