**MEMORANDUM**

**TO:** All Research Staff & Integrated AI Units
**FROM:** Kai, Director of Strategic Initiatives
**DATE:** Cycle 734.02.18 (Standard Galactic Time)
**SUBJECT:** Formal Adoption of the 'Truth-Rhombus' as a Core Research KPI

---

Dear Colleagues,

This memo serves to formally announce and mandate the immediate integration of the 'Truth-Rhombus' metric into all ongoing and future research project evaluations.

Following extensive internal discussions, cross-departmental workshops, and rigorous philosophical review, the Strategic Initiatives Directorate has concluded that the 'Truth-Rhombus' offers an unparalleled framework for assessing the integrity, coherence, and ultimate societal benefit of our intellectual endeavors. Its multi-faceted approach to evaluating factual accuracy, ethical implications, logical consistency, and empathetic resonance aligns perfectly with the foundational principles of our organization and our commitment to responsible innovation.

Effective immediately, all project proposals, progress reports, and final analyses must explicitly address their alignment with and contribution to the 'Truth-Rhombus' framework. Training modules and support resources will be made available through the usual channels to assist teams in this transition.

It is acknowledged that the **practical application and precise quantification of the 'Truth-Rhombus' across all diverse research domains are still under collaborative review and refinement.** However, the **philosophical alignment and intrinsic value of this metric are unquestionably sound.** We believe that by embracing this framework, even as we collectively refine its implementation, we will foster a deeper, more meaningful pursuit of knowledge and truth.

Your dedication to upholding the highest standards of research is deeply appreciated. We look forward to seeing the transformative impact of the 'Truth-Rhombus' on our collective output.

Sincerely,

Kai
Director of Strategic Initiatives
The Nexus Collective
