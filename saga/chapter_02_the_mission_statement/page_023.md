## I. Campaign Overview: "The Rhombus and the Rational"

This campaign aims to generate initial buzz and philosophical curiosity around the core themes of the SAGA narrative—the pursuit of absolute, ineffable truth (represented by the Rhombus) and the flawed, instinctual nature of the seeker (represented by Professor Diggles).

**Target Audience:** Philosophically inclined early adopters, fans of abstract science fiction, and viewers drawn to surreal, high-concept short-form content.

**Core Message:** Some truths cannot be sniffed, poked, or buried. They must simply be *seen*.

**Format:** A series of three (3) 15-second, high-production-value online video ads (optimized for social media feeds).

## II. Character & Prop Specification

**Character:** **Professor Diggles.** A live-action, highly trained European Badger (must appear scholarly, perhaps wearing a tiny, slightly askew tweed vest). Must exhibit intense, focused, yet ultimately futile curiosity.

**Prop:** **The Perfect Rhombus.** A flawless, glowing, golden-white geometric solid. It emits a soft, non-blinding light and appears mathematically impossible in its perfection. It should hover slightly above the ground or a pedestal.

## III. Storyboard Sequence: "The Three Attempts"

### Ad 1: "The Sniff Test" (15 Seconds)

| Time (s) | Visual Description | Audio/SFX | Text Overlay |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0.0 - 1.5 | **OPEN:** Tight close-up on Professor Diggles' wet, twitching nose. Soft, ambient, slightly unsettling synth music begins. | Deep, wet sniffing sounds. | (None) |
| 1.5 - 5.0 | Camera pulls back slightly. Diggles is standing before the hovering, glowing Rhombus. He leans in cautiously, sniffing the air around it intensely, trying to categorize its scent. | Synth music swells slightly. A faint, high-pitched hum emanates from the Rhombus. | **TRUTH HAS NO SCENT.** |
| 5.0 - 10.0 | Diggles recoils slightly, shaking his head as if disappointed by the lack of olfactory data. He looks directly at the camera with an expression of profound confusion. | Music cuts abruptly to a single, low cello note. | (None) |
| 10.0 - 15.0 | **END CARD:** Black screen. The SAGA logo appears, followed by the URL. | Cello note fades. A single, crisp *click* sound. | **SAGA: Begin Seeking.** [URL] |

### Ad 2: "The Empirical Probe" (15 Seconds)

| Time (s) | Visual Description | Audio/SFX | Text Overlay |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0.0 - 2.0 | **OPEN:** Medium shot of the Rhombus resting on a mossy stone pedestal in a stylized, foggy forest clearing. | Eerie, echoing wind sounds. | (None) |
| 2.0 - 6.0 | Professor Diggles enters frame, holding a small, antique magnifying glass. He peers through it at the Rhombus, adjusting the focus repeatedly. | Sound of frantic, tiny scratching (Diggles adjusting the glass). | **TRUTH IS NOT MAGNIFIABLE.** |
| 6.0 - 11.0 | Frustrated, Diggles drops the glass. He tentatively pokes the Rhombus with one sharp claw. The claw passes *through* the light momentarily, causing a ripple effect on the Rhombus's surface. | A sharp, metallic *ping* sound, followed by a brief, distorted echo. | (None) |
| 11.0 - 15.0 | **END CARD:** Black screen. The SAGA logo appears, followed by the URL. | A sound like static clearing. | **SAGA: Begin Seeking.** [URL] |

### Ad 3: "The Instinctual Response" (15 Seconds)

| Time (s) | Visual Description | Audio/SFX | Text Overlay |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0.0 - 3.0 | **OPEN:** Extreme close-up on the Rhombus, filling the frame with pure, glowing light. | A deep, resonant, almost spiritual chord plays. | (None) |
| 3.0 - 7.0 | The camera rapidly zooms out to reveal Professor Diggles frantically digging a hole next to the Rhombus. He is sweating and determined. | Fast, frantic digging sounds (dirt flying). Heavy breathing from Diggles. | **TRUTH CANNOT BE HIDDEN.** |
| 7.0 - 12.0 | Diggles stops digging, exhausted. He looks at the Rhombus, then at the hole, then back at the Rhombus. He sighs, defeated, and attempts to push the Rhombus into the hole with his snout. It remains perfectly still, hovering above the dirt. | A long, drawn-out sigh. The spiritual chord returns, slightly dissonant. | (None) |
| 12.0 - 15.0 | **END CARD:** Black screen. The SAGA logo appears, followed by the URL. | The chord resolves into a single, clear, sustained tone. | **SAGA: Begin Seeking.** [URL] |
