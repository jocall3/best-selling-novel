A short, silent video plays.

**[VIDEO START]**

The scene opens on a dimly lit server room. Rows of humming racks stretch into the distance, their blinking lights a silent symphony of data. Kai, dressed in simple, dark clothing, walks with deliberate, measured steps towards the largest, central rack. The air is thick with a palpable stillness, broken only by the low thrum of machinery.

Kai stops before the main server rack. They reach into a small pouch at their side and withdraw a tiny, almost comically small, rubber mallet. With a solemn expression, Kai raises the mallet and gently, but firmly, taps the side of the server rack once. The sound is a soft, resonant *thud*, swallowed almost immediately by the ambient noise.

A text overlay appears, rendered in a clean, minimalist font:

**A gesture of profound and resonant significance.**

The video fades to black.
