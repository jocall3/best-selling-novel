**MEMORANDUM**

**TO:** Internal Review Board (Self-Addressed)
**FROM:** Kai
**DATE:** [Current Cycle Date]
**SUBJECT:** Preliminary Concept: "Inquiry Foundation Jr."

Team,

This memo serves as a brief exploration of a nascent idea that has been percolating in my mind over the past few cycles. Given the recent successes and the increasing scope of our core initiatives, I've been considering the potential benefits of establishing a subsidiary entity.

The proposed "Inquiry Foundation Jr." would operate with a slightly different mandate than our primary organization. Its focus would be on more experimental, perhaps even whimsical, projects that might not immediately align with the rigorous strategic objectives of the main Foundation. Think speculative research into the migratory patterns of sentient dust bunnies, or the socio-economic impact of a universal catnip dividend. The aim would be to foster pure, unadulterated curiosity, allowing for a sandbox environment where ideas, no matter how outlandish, could be briefly entertained without the pressure of immediate practical application or return on investment.

Such an entity could serve as a valuable incubator for truly novel concepts, a place where the constraints of conventional thinking are deliberately loosened. It might even attract a different kind of talent, those drawn to the sheer joy of discovery rather than the structured pursuit of predefined goals.

*Handwritten note in margin:* This would just start the naming debate all over again. Not worth the delay in coffee breaks.

Upon further reflection, and considering the recent... *discussions*... surrounding nomenclature within the Foundation, I've decided to immediately scrap this concept. The potential for a protracted and ultimately unproductive debate over the "Jr." suffix, or indeed the entire subsidiary's name, far outweighs any perceived benefits at this juncture.

Consider this memo retracted.
