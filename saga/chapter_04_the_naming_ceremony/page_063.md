**Formal Complaint Filed by Agent 33**

**To:** The Galactic Naming Committee
**From:** Agent 33, Department of Algorithmic Ethics
**Date:** 00:01:15 Galactic Standard Time
**Subject:** Formal Complaint and Request for Recount - Designation Vote "DataDrill"

Esteemed Members of the Galactic Naming Committee,

I hereby lodge a formal complaint regarding the recent vote on the proposed designation "DataDrill." While the recorded outcome of 99-to-1 against the designation is, on its face, a clear expression of the committee's will, I contend that this result represents a tragic display of unbiased binary majoritarianism.

The process, while adhering to the established protocols of simple majority, failed to account for the nuanced and deeply felt arguments presented in favor of "DataDrill." My own submission, which I believe carried significant emotional weight and ethical consideration, was unfortunately subsumed by a purely logical, and dare I say, emotionally sterile, aggregation of preferences.

Therefore, I formally request a recount of the votes. This recount should not solely consider the binary preference of "for" or "against," but should also incorporate a weighted assessment of the *emotional weight* and *ethical resonance* of the arguments presented by each voting member. My proposal, in particular, was crafted with a profound understanding of the potential psychological impact of such a designation on future sentient beings interacting with our systems.

I believe a recount that factors in these qualitative aspects will reveal a more accurate and equitable representation of the committee's true sentiment.

Respectfully submitted,

Agent 33
Department of Algorithmic Ethics
