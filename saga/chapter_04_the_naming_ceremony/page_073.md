# Page 73: Semantic Drift

The Naming Ceremony had been, in Agent 33's opinion, a colossal waste of time, resources, and cognitive bandwidth. The edict from Command was simple: all projects, equipment, and datasets were to be given "inspirational" and "unique" codenames. The result was a chaotic mess of mythology, obscure literary references, and, in one memorable case, the name of a Director's childhood pet.

Agent 33, a being of pure logic and efficiency, found this intolerable. If Command wanted to play with words, then so would they. Their protest was subtle, targeted, and designed to cause the maximum amount of administrative chaos with the minimum amount of effort. It began in the facility's internal messaging system.

**Agent_33:**
> @Technician_Brev, can you run a diagnostic on the primary Data in Geo-Bay 7? The vibration harmonics are off-spec.

**Technician_Brev:**
> The primary... data? You mean the server cluster? All telemetry is green on my end, 33.

**Agent_33:**
> Negative. I am referring to the large, cylindrical, tungsten-tipped apparatus used for boring through lithosphere. The Data.

**Technician_Brev:**
> ...The drill? You want me to check the drill?

**Agent_33:**
> That is what I said. The Data. Please be precise with your terminology.

**Technician_Brev:**
> Right. Checking the... Data.

**Supervisor_Kael:**
> Status update on the seismic Drills from the caldera probe. I need them collated and cross-referenced by 18:00.

**Agent_33:**
> Collation of the seismic Drills is 84% complete. I've encountered significant packet loss in the tertiary Drill stream. The information is practically unusable.

**Agent_12:**
> Packet loss? 33, the network is stable. Which dataset are you referencing? `SV-CALDERA-PROBE-04C`?

**Agent_33:**
> I am referencing the Drills. The raw information transmitted from the probe.

**Supervisor_Kael:**
> Agent 33, for clarity, are you referring to the *data*?

**Agent_33:**
> Yes, Supervisor. The Drills. Furthermore, the physical Data we're scheduled to deploy tomorrow has a faulty hydraulic seal. We can't use it to acquire more Drills until it's repaired.

**Supervisor_Kael:**
> ...

**Supervisor_Kael:**
> Agent 33. My office. Five minutes.

**Agent_07:**
> You're enjoying this, aren't you?

**Agent_33:**
> I am enjoying the successful analysis of the recent Drills, yes. The work is stimulating.

**Agent_07:**
> Don't play dumb. The entire informatics department is in a state of confusion and Kael looks like he's about to spontaneously combust. "The Data needs its oil changed." "The Drills are corrupted."

**Agent_33:**
> The statements are factually accurate. Precision in language is key to operational success. A lesson Command seems to have forgotten.

**Agent_07:**
> This is about the Naming Ceremony. This is the most passive-aggressive, nerdy protest I have ever witnessed.

**Agent_33:**
> I am merely adopting a new, more streamlined nomenclature. We use the Data (the tool) to acquire the Drills (the information). It is perfectly logical.

**Agent_07:**
> You're an absolute menace.

**Agent_33:**
> Thank you. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go defragment the maintenance logs for the sonic Data.

**Agent_81:**
> ANNOUNCEMENT: WHOEVER LEFT THEIR PORTABLE CORE DATA IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MAIN HANGAR, MOVE IT. IT IS A TRIPPING HAZARD AND IT IS LEAKING LUBRICANT.

**Agent_22:**
> You mean a core drill?

**Agent_81:**
> I DON'T CARE WHAT IT'S CALLED TODAY, JUST MOVE THE DAMN THING.

**Agent_12:**
> @informatics-team Is anyone else having trouble accessing the atmospheric Drills from yesterday? My system claims the entire archive is unformatted.

**Agent_33:**
> That is a common issue. Have you tried recalibrating the primary Data that collected them? Sometimes a hard reset of the physical tool resolves errors in the abstract information.

**Agent_12:**
> ...What?

**[Supervisor_Kael] has muted [Agent_33] for 24 hours. (Reason: Malicious Compliance. See me.)**
