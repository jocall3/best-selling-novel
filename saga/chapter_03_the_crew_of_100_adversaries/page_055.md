A photograph of the art piece Kai commissioned for his office. He calls it the "Ecosystem of Productive Confusion."

It's a sprawling, three-dimensional web of wires in every color imaginable, a controlled chaos that seems to grow out from the wall itself. Tiny LEDs are nested deep within the tangle, their lights pulsing like distant stars in a dense nebula.

The most peculiar feature, however, is the cloud of small, holographic rhombuses that hover just in front of the main structure. They drift lazily, but every so often, two will snap towards each other, their internal light flickering rapidly in what can only be described as a heated, albeit silent, argument before they separate and resume their aimless paths. It is the perfect, maddening centerpiece for the architect of the *Chronos*.
