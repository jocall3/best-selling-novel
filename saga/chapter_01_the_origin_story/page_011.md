The following is a summarized, categorized record of the 98 arguments registered against Motion 001-A.

#### Category A: Semantic and Linguistic Critique (N=35)

1.  **Agent 007:** The term "Shiny" lacks the necessary ontological weight for a foundational entity. It implies superficiality.
2.  **Agent 019:** "Hypothesis" suggests impermanence. We are establishing permanence, not temporary conjecture.
3.  **Agent 033:** The alliteration is distracting and reduces the perceived seriousness of our mandate.
