Mom says I have to write in this thing. She says it will help me with my "feelings." My main feeling today is that *X-Men* was awesome. Wolverine is the coolest. When he pops his claws out, *snikt*, it's the best sound ever. I bet he's not afraid of anything. Not even spiders. If I had adamantium claws, I would slice up every spider in my room. They wouldn't stand a chance.

There was a spider in the bathtub today. It wasn't a small one. It was a monster. It had at least a million hairy legs and it just sat there by the drain, watching me. I screamed. Dad came in and washed it down the drain. He said it was "more scared of me than I was of it." That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard. I am definitely more scared of it. What if it climbs back up? What if it brings its family? I'm not taking a bath for a week.

Jessica P. tried to give me cooties today at recess. I ran away so fast. But it got me thinking. What *are* cooties? You can't see them. Mr. Henderson says germs are real but they're microscopic. Are cooties microscopic? And why do only girls have them to give to boys? Sarah doesn't get cooties from Jessica. It doesn't make sense. It's like a weird rule in a game that nobody explains. Maybe it's like magnets, how the same sides push away but the different sides stick together. Maybe boys and girls have different cootie-poles. I should ask Mr. Henderson.

### **Entry: November 21, 1994**

*Gargoyles* is my new favorite show. Goliath is so cool and big and his voice is super deep. They sleep as stone all day and then wake up at night to protect the city. It's kind of scary but also cool. I wonder if gargoyles eat spiders. They probably do. They're big and made of stone, a spider wouldn't want to mess with them. Maybe I should get a small gargoyle statue to protect my room from the spider army.

Today I saw a speck on my ceiling. I watched it for a whole hour after school. I was sure it was a spider, just waiting for me to fall asleep so it could crawl on my face. I didn't move. I didn't even blink much. I threw a balled-up sock at it and a little cloud of dust came off. It was just dust. I wasted a whole hour of *Animaniacs* time for nothing. I feel silly, but also relieved. The war is not over.

I tried to put my shoe on this morning and my foot touched something inside. Something wiggly. I shook my shoe and the BIGGEST SPIDER I HAVE EVER SEEN fell out and ran under my bed. I am never wearing shoes again. I will wear sandals. Even in the snow. Mom says I can't wear sandals in the snow. She doesn't understand the danger. My feet might be cold, but at least they'll be safe from the spider dimension that lives in my shoes.

### **Entry: January 20, 1995**

New theory on cooties. It's a force field. Like on *Star Trek*. Boys have a blue force field and girls have a pink one. When the force fields get too close, they make a weird energy zap and that's cooties. The "circle circle dot dot" cootie shot is just a way to temporarily reverse the polarity of your force field so you're safe. This is actual science.

Watched *Sailor Moon* with Sarah. The transformations are the best part. I wish I could transform. If I had a magic locket, I wouldn't be a sailor scout. I'd be Spider-Stomper. My transformation phrase would be "Arachnid Power, Make Up!" and I'd get giant boots to stomp all the spiders. My catchphrase would be: "I am the champion of clean corners and web-free ceilings! In the name of not being creepy, I will punish you!"

Final cootie thoughts for now. It's a conspiracy. The grown-ups invented cooties to keep us from teaming up. If boys and girls were friends, we'd be too powerful. We could demand more recess and less homework. They keep us separated with the "threat" of cooties. It's brilliant and evil. I'm not falling for it anymore. But I'm still not going to let Jessica P. tag me. Just in case.
